# Description of the project
My project is an engaging and challenging 3D game where players control a cube tasked
with  navigating through a series of increasingly difficult obstacle courses.The game 
focuses on the player's ability to precisely control the cube, avoiding various 
obstacles to reach the finish line.

# Instructions for use
You boot up the game by starting up the scene for main_menu. You then recieve two
options: either to play the game or to quit. If quit is selected, the game closes. If
the user presses "Play game" it brings you to a new menu. Here you can select either
level one or level two. Level one has multiple obstacles, which you must first
traverse backwards and then back forwards. To control the cube, you can use W to go
forward, A to go left, D to go right, S to go back and space to jump. The goal is to
make it through the green and pink poles. Once you make it through, you're given the
option to select another level, where you're brought back to the screen to select a 
level. Level two is a much more simpler level, where you must traverse backwards and
accurately aim to go between the finish line poles.

# How it works
Gameplay Mechanics and Player Interaction:

Player Control:
Players control a 3D cube using keyboard inputs.
The primary controls are for moving the cube left, right, up, down and for making the cube jump.

Obstacle Navigation:
First level is populated with a variety of obstacles that are static.
Static obstacles are blocks and walls that the player must avoid or jump over.
The player must navigate through these obstacles to reach the end of each level.

Level Progression:
The game consists of two levels.
The progression is linear, with each level unlocking after the previous one is completed.

Scoring System:
The game tracks the time taken to complete each level.
The faster a level is completed, the better the score.
This encourages players to replay levels to improve their times.

Technical Aspects:

Physics and Movement:
The cube's movement is governed by physics rules set in the Godot Engine, using a RigidBody3D node.
Collisions with obstacles are managed by Godotâ€™s physics engine, ensuring realistic interactions.

User Interface:
The game includes a user interface displaying the current level and time elapsed.
At the end of each level, the UI updates to show the player's time and the option to choose the next level.

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
One of the aspects I am most proud of is how I overcame the technical challenges
involved in game development. Mastering the complexities of the Godot Engine
and GDScript, especially in managing 3D physics and collision detection, was a
significant achievement for me.


# What I learned
I significantly improved my understanding of the Godot Engine and GDScript.
Learning how to effectively use a game engine for 3D development, manage physics
interactions, and script complex game mechanics was a substantial part of my technical
learning.

# Proposal submitted earlier can go here:
My project  3D game set in a minimalistic environment. The player controls a cube
with the ability to move left, right, up, down, and jump. The course is filled with
various obstacles, and the player's goal is to reach the finish line without colliding
with these obstacles.
